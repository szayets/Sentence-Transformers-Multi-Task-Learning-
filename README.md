This project expands a sentence transformer model for multi-task learning, handling both sentence classification and sentiment analysis. It explores different training strategies various network components and leveraging transfer learning for optimization. Finally, a simple training loop is implemented to demonstrate how multi-task learning operates with hypothetical data.
